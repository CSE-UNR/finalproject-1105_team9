Functions:
Main - 
Data: 2-D array for image, variables for user inputs
Functionality: 	In a loop, display and select option from menu, load new image, display current image, edit current image, or exit the program. If edit image, display edit menu and select option: crop, dim, brighten, (maybe rotate  90*). Display option to save changes to a new file and promt for file name. Return to first menu.

saveImage  - 
Input: FILE* pointer, char imageArray, int imageSizeArray
Output: none
Functionality:  Prompt user to save their edited image; if yes, prompt for save file name. Open file and use nested for loop to print image into the file, then close file.

editMenu  - 
Input: int menuChoice
Output: user menu choice.

cropImage  - 
Input:	char imageArray, int imageSizeArray
Output: new image
Functionality: Display the users image dimensions, promt for start and end points in the x and y (so 4 values).  Use nested for loop to create new image by started at the top left of new cut (x1 and y2), saving that as character  [0][0] in new imageArray, and repeating until hitting the x limit in the inner loop, and y limit in the outer loop reaching the bottom right coordinate. 

colorImage  - 
Input: char imageArray, int imageSizeArray, 
Output: new image
Functionality: If statement deciding if the image will be dimmed or brightened. Nested for loop with inner switch statement checking each image character and changing it based on dim or brighten. Ex. if imageArray[x][y] is == to ‘.’ , then imageArray[x][y] = ‘o’ for brightening.
	
displayImage  - 
Input: char imageArray, int imageArraySize
Output: none
Functionality: nested for loop displaying the image to the terminal with the image size as limits.

loadImage  -
